I'm a French student passionate about all kinds of technology. Currently studying cybersecurity, I also love programming and challenging myself with CTFs to develop my knowledge and skills.
Python is my main language, but I'm also curious about various programming languages like C++, web-based languages like JavaScript, and even statistical computing with R.
My main goal is to sharpen my skills in all areas of cybersecurity while learning the fundamentals of Python to develop tools for solving CTFs and tackling everyday problems.
